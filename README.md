# Marble

## First game for my portfolio

**This is just a simple game in which I try to use the concepts I've learned so far.**

The user controls a marble ball usign WASD keys. The player movement is controlled using State Machines. Using the G key enables interaction with some objects (two lifts and a button that also controls the lifts). The interaction between player and objects is done using Interfaces and the communications between the lifts and the button is done using Events. The UI is also updated based on Events triggered by the player.

The camera follows the player around. It is possible to rotate it using QE keys.

The gameplay loop is very simple. Collect all the stars and that's it.
